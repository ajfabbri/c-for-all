c-for-all
=========

Example C library callable from Java, Python, and other languages.

Motivation
----------

I want a skeleton or template library that:

- Is implemented in C.
- Uses Autotools / Gnu Make to build.
- Is callable from Java, Python, and other languages.
- Uses SWIG to create bindings for other languages.

How To Build
------------

- Install swig.

e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu, `apt-get install swig2.0`
